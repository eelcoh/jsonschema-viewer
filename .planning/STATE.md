## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

No decisions logged yet. See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

- [Phase 01-foundation-and-input]: Replaced Debug.ToString in constant/fail with literal string — type is generic a, Json.Encode not applicable
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-input]: Removed swagger constant — Swagger 2.0 spec is not JSON Schema, unsuitable as example
- [Phase 01-foundation-and-input]: Upgrade to Browser.element with stub update handlers; full input logic deferred to Plan 02

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Debug.log calls in Render/Svg.elm are a hard blocker for --optimize builds; must be the first change in Phase 1
- Circular $ref in real-world schemas will cause infinite recursion without a visited-set guard; addressed in Phase 2
